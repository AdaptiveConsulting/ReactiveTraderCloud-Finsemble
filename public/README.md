# `public` / `docs` folders

The contents of the `./public` folder will be copied to the root of the `./docs` folder (therefore available on the root of the Github Pages website) upon running `npm run deploy`. See `README.md` on project root for more details

> The Github Pages website is served from the `./docs` folder on the `master` branch, so make sure its contents are accurate.
