For better performance, we recommend most of your code's instrumentation be based on the Logger Client (e.g., `FSBL.Clients.Logger.debug(...)` instead of the `console.debug(...)`).\r\n *\r\n * Using the Logger is similar to using the browser's console for logging (e.g., `console.error` or `console.log`), although the Logger Client is accessed through the FSBL object as shown in the examples below.\r\n *\r\n *```javascript\r\n * \t\t\tFSBL.Clients.Logger.error(\"an error message\", anErrorOject);\r\n * \t\t\tFSBL.Clients.Logger.warn(\"a warning message\", object1, object2, object3);\r\n * \t\t\tFSBL.Clients.Logger.log(\"logging message\");\r\n * \t\t\tFSBL.Clients.Logger.info(\"logging message\");\r\n * \t\t\tFSBL.Clients.Logger.log(\"log message\");\r\n * \t\t\tFSBL.Clients.Logger.debug(\"debug message\");\r\n *```\r\n * The Logger Client also supports system logging (e.g., `Logger.system.log`) for Finsemble's internal logging. All Finsemble client APIs are in the process of being instrumented to log their entry-point calls and parameters, as shown below.\r\n *\r\n *```javascript\r\n * \t\t\tLogger.system.info(\"RouterClient.transmit\", \"TO CHANNEL\", toChannel, \"EVENT\", event);\r\n *```\r\n * Developers can view all system logging in the Central Logger, although only `Logger.system.info` messages (recording API interactions) are intended for use outside the Finsemble development team.\r\n *\r\n *<strong>Note:</strong> Any service can also use the Logger by directing requiring the client. The Logger can immediately be used, but log message will not be transmitted to the Central Logger until `Logger.start()` is invoked (as shown below).\r\n *```javascript\r\n *\r\n * \t\t\tvar Logger = require(\"../../clients/logger\").default;\r\n * \t\t\tLogger.log(\"Service Ready\");\r\n * \t\t\tLogger.start();\r\n *```\r\n * @hideConstructor\r\n * @shouldBePublished true\r\n * @class Logger\r\n * @constructor\r\n */\r\nexport var LoggerConstructor = function (dependencies?: { RouterClient: any;

Multiple hotkeys may be created for the same key combination, so long as they have different handler functions.\r\n\r\n-When the service detects that all of the keys in the hotkey combination are pressed, it sends a message on the \"HotkeyTriggered\" channel (the method for this is \"ListenForHotkeys\") which contains the list of all windows registered with that hotkey combination. The client then reads the list of windows, and checks if it's one of those windows. If it is, it fires off the node js event emitter that was registered for that hotkey.\r\n\r\n-Removing a hotkey clears the corresponding event emitter, and also sends a router message to the service to remove its windowid from the array of windows registered for the hotkey combination - if the window is registered with that hotkey combination multiple times, it will only remove one, allowing other hotkeys on the same window with the same key combination to still be registered.\r\n\r\n*/\r\nimport { _BaseClient as BaseClient } from \"./baseClient\";\r\nimport RouterClient from \"./routerClientInstance\";\r\nimport Logger from \"./logger\";\r\n\r\nconst keyMap = require(\"../common/keyMaps.json\").dictionary;\r\n\r\nimport { IGlobals } from \"../common/Globals\";\r\n/** The global `window` object.

Requires \"path\" to be specified, which may be the name of an executable on the system path, a system file path or system installed URI.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **native** - A native window that has implemented finsemble.dll. Requires \"path\" to be specified. [For more information](tutorial-RPCService.html).\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **application** - A standalone application. This launch a component in its own browser process (splintered, giving it dedicated CPU and memory).\r\n\t * This can also point to a standalone web application (such as from a third party).\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param {string} [params.alias] Used when windowType is \"native\" or \"assimilation\".

These arguments can be captured by the native application\r\n\t * in order to tie it to Finsemble's window tracking. When building an application with finsemble.dll, this is handled automatically. Those arguments are:\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **uuid** - A generated UUID that uniquely identifies this window.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **left** - The x coordinate of the new window\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **top** - The y coordinate of the new window\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **width** - The width of the new window\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **height** - The height of the new window\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **openfinVersion** - The OpenFin version that Finsemble runs (necessary for native windows to connection on the OpenFin IAB)\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **openfinSocketPort** - The OpenFin socket used for the Inter-application Bus (IAB) (necessary for Java windows that wish to use the OpenFin IAB)\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **finsembleWindowName** - The name of the window in the Finsemble config\r\n\t *\r\n\t * **componentType** - The component type in the Finsemble config\r\n\t *\r\n\t * A common troublesome problem is when a native application needs to be launched from an intermediary application (such as a launcher or batch script). That intermediary\r\n\t * application can pass these parameters which will allow the final application to connect back to Finsemble.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param {string} [params.arguments] Used when windowType is \"native\" or \"assimilation\". Specifies the arguments to be sent to the application. This is used in conjunction with path.\r\n\t * Arguments should be separated by spaces: `--arg1 foo --arg2 bar` _except_ when `params.argumentsAsQueryString` is true, in which case set this parameter to be single string in URI format: `arg=1&arg=2`\"\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param {boolean} [params.argumentsAsQueryString] For native applications launched by URI: 1) the string is passed as the \"arguments\" parameter if appended as a query string; and 2) the automatically generated arguments described in \"path\" above are appended to the query string\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param {any} [params.env] Sets environment variables for a spawned native application. Create a map (JSON) object of names to values. This is only available when running assimilation and with the config assimilation.useOpenFinSpawn=false.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * @param {any} [params.env] Sets environment variables for a spawned native application. Create a map (JSON) object of names to values.

If not provided, then a random name will be assigned to the newly created `OpenFin` window.\r\n\r\n\t * @param {string} [params.groupName] Optional group name. Adds windows to a group (unrelated to docking or linking) that is used for window management functions. If the group does not exist it will be created.\r\n\r\n\t * @param {any} [params.data] Optional data to pass to the opening window.\r\n\t * If set, then the spawned window can use {@link WindowClient#getSpawnData} to retrieve the data.\r\n\r\n\t * @param {WindowDescriptor} [params.options] Properties to merge with the default windowDescriptor.\r\n\t * Any value set here will be sent directly to the `OpenFin` window, and will override the effect of relevant parameters to spawn(). By default, all Finsemble windows are frameless.\r\n\r\n\t * @param {boolean} [params.addToWorkspace=false] Whether to add the new component to the workspace.\r\n\t * Even when true, the window will still not be added to the workspace if addToWorkspace==false in components.json config for the component type.\r\n\r\n\t * @param {Function=} cb Callback to be invoked after function is completed.
