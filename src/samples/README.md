#  Finsemble Samples

This folder contains a set sample templates to help you get started using Finsemble. 

Finsemble is a set of tools that lets you build multi-window desktop applications that focus on coordination and collaboration. We've packaged the seed project with templates to demonstrate the sort of desktop experience that you can deliver to your users. You can use these templates wholesale or can use them as customizable building blocks to design your own components. 

These samples were built using React UI Controls. The primary use for the controls is for developers to assemble and customize their toolbar. Using the controls, a developer can make the toolbar do anything&mdash;quickly. The controls are available in a separate public repo: https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-react-controls. 

Read through the documentation to get a better idea how these components are built. Browse to each component for its relevant documentation.
