#  Finsemble Samples

This folder contains all our sample components to help you get started using Finsemble. 

Even though Finsemble is **not** a general purpose browser, we've packaged it with several standard UI components. You can use them wholesale to create an out-of-the-box UI experience or use them as customizable building blocks to design your own. These sample components illustrate how easy it is to incorporate new features into Finsemble. 

Read through the documentation to get a better idea how these components are built. Browse to each component for its relevant documentation.
