#  Finsemble Samples

This folder contains all our sample components to help you get started using Finsemble. 

Finsemble is a set of tools that let you build multi-window desktop applications that focus on coordination and collaboration. We've packaged the seed project with sample components to serve as templates in order demonstrate the sort of desktop experience that you can deliver to your users. You can use these templates wholesale or can use them as customizable building blocks to design your own. Many of these sample components were built using Finsemble's React Controls, a set of UI components. 

Read through the documentation to get a better idea how these components are built. Browse to each component for its relevant documentation.
