#  Finsemble Samples

This folder contains all our sample components to help you get started using Finsemble. 

Even though Finsemble is **not** a general web browser, we've packaged it with several standard UI components. You can use them wholesale to create an out-of-the-box UI experience or use them as customizable building blocks to design your own. 

Browse to each component for the relevant documentation. Read through the documentation to get a better idea how these components are built.
