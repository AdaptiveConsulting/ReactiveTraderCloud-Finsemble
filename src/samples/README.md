#  Finsemble Samples

This folder contains a set of templates to help you get started using Finsemble. 

Finsemble is a set of tools that lets you build multi-window desktop applications that focus on coordination and collaboration. We've packaged the seed project with these templates to demonstrate the sort of desktop experience that you can deliver to your users. You can use these templates wholesale or use them as building blocks. 

These samples were built using React UI Controls. The primary use for the controls is for developers to assemble and customize their toolbar. Using the controls, a developer can make the toolbar do anything&mdash;quickly. The controls are available in a separate public repo: https://github.com/ChartIQ/finsemble-react-controls. 

Read through the documentation to get a better idea how the sample templates are built. Browse each template for its relevant documentation.
